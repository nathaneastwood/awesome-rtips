# Preface {-}

```{r knitrPrefs, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  out.width = "80%",
  fig.align = "center",
  eval = TRUE
)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggrepel)
```

The purpose of this document is to collect together awesome R tips that I have seen on Twitter and elsewhere on the interweb. Sometimes I would see a tip and it may be out of date due to deprecation or it would only have a picture of the code. So this repository provides tests for the tips I have collated.

If you see any additional awesome R tips that you think would be a great addition to this document then please feel free to submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/nathaneastwood/awesome-rtips/pulls).
